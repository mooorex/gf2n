# Binary Extension Field

## Introduction

This is an experimental implementation of binary extension field operations.

To construct a binary extension finite field GF(2^n), an irreducible polynomial f(x) over GF(2) of degree n is used. In current implementation, it requires that the degree must be strictly less than 64.
